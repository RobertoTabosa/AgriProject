# AgriProject
This is a Machine Learning project using Python to identify and display in a GIS the most suitable areas for planting oats in the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan / Canada.

Project: AgTech Capstone - OATS
Final Project | Stream 3 by Roberto Tabosa

Scoping

Problem/Opportunity
With the growing decline in oat planting in Manitoba and Saskatchewan*, 
a group of companies supplying oat grains needs to understand more 
precisely the best locations for crop oats and thus make better future investment decisions when production returns to normal.

Solution
Recommendation of best areas using K-means clustering for 
oat cultivation.
